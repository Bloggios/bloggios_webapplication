                These Legal Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between the user ('you'), whether personally or
                on behalf of an entity, and the entity operating the Services, concerning your access to and use of the
                Services. By accessing the Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be
                bound by all of these Legal Terms. Failure to agree with all of these Legal Terms expressly prohibits
                you from using the Services, and you must discontinue use immediately.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
                Prior notice will be provided for any scheduled changes to the Services you are using. Changes to the
                Legal Terms will become effective twenty (20) days after the notice is given, except in cases where
                changes apply to new functionality and security updates, in which case they will be effective
                immediately. By continuing to use the Services after the effective date of any changes, you agree to be
                bound by the modified terms. If you disagree with such changes, you may terminate Services in accordance
                with the 'TERM AND TERMINATION' section.

                The Services are intended for users who are at least 13 years of age. All users who are minors in the

                directly supervised by, their parent or guardian to use the Services. If you are a minor, you must have
                your parent or guardian read and agree to these Legal Terms prior to using the Services.

                such laws, you are prohibited from utilizing the Services. Furthermore, usage of the Services in any
                manner that would contravene the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) is strictly prohibited.

                This license includes the right to create derivative works of your Contributions and to sublicense these

                It's important to note that we do not claim ownership over your Contributions, and you retain full

            <Paragraph>
                As part of our Services, users have the option to link their accounts with third-party service
                providers, hereafter referred to as 'Third-Party Accounts.' This integration enhances functionality and
                allows for a seamless user experience. There are two methods by which users can link their accounts:
                <br/><br/>
                Users may choose to input their Third-Party Account login credentials directly into our Services.
                Alternatively, users may grant us access to their Third-Party Accounts, in accordance with the terms and
                conditions governing the use of each Third-Party Account.
                <br/><br/>
                By linking a Third-Party Account, users represent and warrant that they are authorized to disclose their
                Third-Party Account login information to us. They also confirm that they are not in breach of any terms
                and conditions governing the use of the Third-Party Account, and they are not subjecting us to any fees
                or usage limitations imposed by the third-party service provider.
                <br/><br/>
                Upon linking a Third-Party Account, users understand that we may access, retrieve, and store any content
                provided by the user on their Third-Party Account ('Social Network Content'). This content becomes
                accessible through our Services via the user's account. Additionally, depending on the Third-Party
                Account, we may exchange additional information with the Third-Party Account, subject to user
                notification.
                <br/><br/>
                Personally identifiable information posted on Third-Party Accounts may be accessible through the user's
                account on our Services, subject to the privacy settings configured by the user. If access to a
                Third-Party Account is terminated or becomes unavailable, Social Network Content may no longer be
                accessible through our Services. Users maintain control over the connection between their account on our
                Services and their Third-Party Accounts and can disable the connection at any time through their account
                settings or by contacting us directly.
                <br/><br/>
                Users acknowledge that their relationship with third-party service providers associated with their
                Third-Party Accounts is governed solely by their agreements with such providers. We do not review Social
                Network Content for accuracy, legality, or non-infringement. We may access users' email address books
                and contacts lists solely for the purpose of identifying contacts registered to use our Services.
                <br/><br/>
                Upon request, we will attempt to delete any information obtained from Third-Party Accounts stored on our
                servers, with the exception of the username and profile picture associated with the user's account. This
                integration enhances user experience while providing transparency, control, and privacy considerations
                regarding the handling of data from Third-Party Accounts.
